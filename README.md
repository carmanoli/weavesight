**WeaveSight is a personal knowledge management tool designed to help you connect the dots between your daily notes, tasks, and long-term goals. It's an experimental Progressive Web App (PWA) built with a focus on privacy, simplicity, and the power of on-device AI.**

This project is being developed as an entry for the Google AI Chrome Contest, exploring the potential of running AI models directly in the browser for a faster and more secure user experience.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Unified Dashboard:** A central place for your notes, to-do lists, and project trackers.
*   **Intelligent Linking:** WeaveSight automatically suggests connections between related pieces of information, helping you discover patterns in your own data.

## üí° The Problem I'm Solving

In a world of information overload, our personal knowledge is often scattered across countless apps and documents. We have notes here, tasks there, and project plans somewhere else. This fragmentation makes it difficult to see the bigger picture and connect ideas.

Tools like Notion or Obsidian are powerful, but they often rely on the cloud or have a steep learning curve. WeaveSight aims to offer a simpler, privacy-first alternative by leveraging the power of AI that runs entirely on your own device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built using a modern web development stack:

*   **Frontend:** React.js with Vite for a fast development experience.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first and responsive design.
*   **On-Device AI:** Using the [Google AI Edge](https://ai.google.dev/edge) models (e.g., Gemma) via the Web ML APIs.
*   **Local Storage:** IndexedDB for persistent, offline data storage directly in the browser.
*   **PWA Functionality:** Service Workers to manage offline capabilities and caching.
